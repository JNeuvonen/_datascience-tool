`_datascience-tool` is a tool for simplifying common computing tasks data scientists and ML engineers perform on datasets. These include tasks such as combining datasets, creating row-wise aggregations, visualizing data, and removing nulls. This is mostly dull-to-write and repetitive code that interfaces with Pandas. This routine data manipulation code is repetitive and tedious to write, and `_datascience-tool` aims to automate these common data manipulation tasks.
